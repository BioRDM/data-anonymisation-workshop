# Data anonymisation exercise

This folder contains three datasets with sensitive patient data (note that all the data present here is entirely fictional):

- `fake_circadian_dataset_Example1_Sleep_data.xlsx`
    - A quantitative dataset corresponding to a sleep study, containing demographic, medical and sleep-related information for 20 patients
- `fake_circadian_dataset_Example_2_Biological_Lab.xlsx`
    - A quantitative dataset corresponding to a genetic study, containing demographic, medical and gene expression information for 20 patients
- `Example 1 - Qualitative Dataset.doc`
    - A qualitative dataset containing an interview transcript between a doctor and a patient

The file `Exercise Solutions.docx` contains recommendations on how to anonymise each of these datasets.

We recommend that you first try to anonymise the datasets without looking at the solutions (but you can use the slides in [Presentation](./../Presentation/) as guide), and then compare your answers to the solutions.

Note that anonymisation is highly context-dependent, and therefore there is not a single way to efficiently anonymise a dataset.
